### Code for reproduction of results

This repo contains scripts and configs for reproducing the results of Kuhlmann & Capel, The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 994, Issue 2, id.136, 16 pp.

If you attempt to run the analyses, beware of the runtime: on 256 threads the fits will take on the order hours using 4 chains and 5k samples (1k warmup, 4k actual samples) each.
